# snake-game

This is a basic implementation based on the very popular kids game most commonly called the "Snake game".

The user controls the continuously moving snake and must use the arrow keys to traverse it towards delicious cherries to grow longer and longer.
The more cherries the snake eats, the more points the user earns.
